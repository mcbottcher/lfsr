# lfsr
Design a LFSR from scratch to learn some Verilog

Idea is to use Basys3 Board to implement a Linear Feedback Shift Register with LEDs.

User should be able to control which taps are used for XOR operations using the board's switches.

User should be able to reset using one of the on board buttons.
